# Detection-Lab

## Objective

The Elastic SIEM Lab project aimed to set up a functioning Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using the Elastic Stack. The focus was on ingesting and analyzing logs in real time to detect security events and identify potential threats within a network. This hands-on experience enhanced my understanding of log management, threat detection, and security monitoring, simulating real-world attack scenarios.

### Skills Learned

-Deep understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
-Proficiency in configuring and utilizing the Elastic Stack for log collection and analysis.
-Ability to create Kibana dashboards to visualize network activity and detect anomalies.
-Familiarity with Filebeat and Winlogbeat for shipping logs from endpoints.
-Enhanced knowledge of log correlation, event analysis, and threat detection in a networked environment.

### Tools Used

-Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for real-time log ingestion, analysis, and visualization.
-Filebeat and Winlogbeat for collecting and forwarding logs to Elasticsearch.
-Kibana for creating custom dashboards and performing security event analysis.
-Ubuntu 20.04 as the base operating system for setting up the SIEM environment.

## Steps
Here are the key steps and insights from the lab:

Elastic Stack Setup
Installed and configured Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for log management and data visualization. This step provided a foundation for collecting and analyzing security event data.


Ref 1: Elastic Stack components configured to ingest logs.

Beats Configuration
Configured Filebeat and Winlogbeat to ship logs from endpoints, enabling real-time log collection from Windows and Linux systems.


Ref 2: Filebeat and Winlogbeat successfully forwarding logs to Elasticsearch.

Kibana Dashboards
Created custom Kibana dashboards to visualize log data and detect unusual activity within the network. This step enhanced my ability to monitor security events and quickly identify threats.

Security Event Analysis
Analyzed the collected data for potential security threats and unusual patterns, simulating real-world attack scenarios.
